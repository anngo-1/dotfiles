## Sway Config

This is a minimalistic sway configuration. It uses xfce4-terminal, pavucontrol, blueman, rofi, and waybar.

The waybar included in this repository borrows from this tutorial [here](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-configure-and-customize-waybar-on-linux), with an added on bluetooth manager that interfaces with blueman when clicked.
