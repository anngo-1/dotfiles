## config

This is my personal hyprland and sway configurations.

The hyprland dots are from [JakooLit's hyprland dots](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots). The waybar and terminal are configured to use the Catppuccin mocha blue theme.

To apply the zsh theme, copy an.zsh-theme to your .oh-my-zsh/themes directory. Then, copy the .zshrc in this repository to your .zshrc.
